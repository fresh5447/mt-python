# Bug

Proxy Server Fires up on port 3100 even though it is supposed to fire up on 3001.

In this mode, does not give proper server error. Instead simply says can not proxy server.

Admin Course List Container is not un-mounting.

Edit Course - Publish does not pre-populate value.

Reset password will crash if email is not found.

Reset email uses host in link. This redirects to the server host.

Adds extra route when we hit refresh
